# **üó∫Ô∏è App Flow, Pages & Roles: Voice-Activated Reading List App**

This technical document outlines the full application flow, page structure, and user role logic for the MVP version of the app. It is designed for development and UI/UX reference.

---

## **üë• User Roles**

* **User (default)**: All users have the same capabilities in the MVP.

* No admin panel or moderation functions are planned at this stage.

---

## **üîÅ Overall App Flow (MVP)**

1. **Onboarding**

   * User opens app for the first time

   * Chooses basic personalization (e.g., "What kind of reader are you?")

   * Enters email to create profile or logs in (OAuth or passwordless email)

   * App sets user preferences in memory/database

2. **Voice Entry**

   * User taps mic icon (or says activation command)

   * Speaks a book-related phrase

   * App transcribes voice using Google STT

   * Transcription is passed to GPT-4 to extract metadata

   * App confirms: "Did you mean this book by \[Author\]?"

   * User confirms (voice or tap)

   * Entry is saved and user gets response: "Added to your reading list\!"

3. **Reading List Management**

   * User accesses visual list

   * Can filter, search, or sort entries

   * Can tag or prioritize entries

   * Can group entries by category, topic, or source

4. **Reminders / Recall**

   * User asks app (via voice or text): "What did I save from the podcast last week?"

   * App returns entries matching query context

   * Option to set reminder for later or reorder list

5. **User Settings & Personalization**

   * Update reading preferences (e.g., parenting, professional, hobby)

   * Control reminders, voice interaction tone, and responses

   * Export or back up reading list
