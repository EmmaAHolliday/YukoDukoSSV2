# **üìã Implementation Plan & Scope: Voice-Activated Reading List App**

## **Overview**

This implementation plan defines the key phases and tasks for delivering the MVP and initial scaling features of the voice-first book tracking app. The plan emphasizes fast iteration, minimal complexity, and user-centered value delivery within a 2‚Äì3 day MVP window.

---

## **üéØ Project Goals**

* Deliver a functioning MVP within 2‚Äì3 days

* Allow voice input to create structured reading list entries

* Handle vague and varied phrasing gracefully using GPT-4

* Store book entries and allow later recall, search, and filtering

* Provide a solid foundation for long-term personalization and monetization

---

## **üîÑ Phased Development Approach**

### **‚úÖ Phase 1: Core Voice-to-List MVP (Day 1‚Äì2)**

**Goal:** Turn voice input into structured book entries stored per user

**Tasks:**

* Set up Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for transcription

* Build GPT-4 prompt structure to extract book metadata

* Design minimum user profile schema (ID, email, preferences)

* Log entries to Notion or Google Sheets (user-separated)

  * Choose one based on developer comfort and speed of integration

* Respond to user with confirmation (voice or text)

* Handle GPT clarification prompts (e.g., "Did you mean...?")

* Consider short-term local capture of raw voice for retry/debug, optionally enabled per user

**Deliverables:**

* Voice ‚Üí GPT ‚Üí Storage pipeline

* Confirmation response

* Success \= Book entry captured from voice input and correctly stored with confirmation

---

### **‚úÖ Phase 2: Smart Layer and Categorization (Day 2‚Äì3)**

**Goal:** Increase usefulness and add basic personalization

**Tasks:**

* Add GPT logic to assign genre/category

* Allow users to tag priority or create custom labels

* Store book source/context (e.g., ‚Äúheard on Tim Ferriss‚Äù)

* Add recall query: ‚ÄúWhat did I save from \[source/author\]?‚Äù

* Begin light user profile logic (parenting, research, etc.)

* Create lightweight logging dashboard (Notion/Sheet) for prompt review

**Deliverables:**

* Categorized entries

* Contextual recall working

* Basic personalization config screen

* Success \= User can organize and retrieve books based on categories or context

---

### **‚úÖ Phase 3: Visual Reading List & UI Polish (Post-MVP)**

**Goal:** Enable visual browsing, filtering, and prioritizing of entries

**Tasks:**

* Build searchable reading list view

* Add filters: category, author, saved date, source

* Enable manual edits and delete/undo

* Sort by rating, priority, or cost (using metadata or GPT-lookup)

**Deliverables:**

* Visual interface for managing reading list

* Success \= Users can browse, edit, and prioritize entries visually

---

### **‚úÖ Phase 4: Scale, Monetization, and Infrastructure**

**Goal:** Lay foundation for performance and monetization

**Tasks:**

* Migrate storage to Firebase or Supabase

* Implement email-based auth with account isolation

* Add monetization features:

  * Premium subscription plan

  * Book affiliate links

  * Export/share lists

  * Book summary unlocks

**Deliverables:**

* Secure, scalable backend

* Payment readiness

* Success \= User accounts and monetization features are active and testable

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Prioritization Logic**

| Priority | Focus Area | Rationale |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| High | Voice transcription & GPT parsing | Core experience; unlocks rest of workflow |
| High | Basic data storage \+ separation | Enables personalized user flow |
| Med | Clarification & confirmation responses | Improves quality of entries |
| Med | Tagging & filtering | Enables later management and monetization |
| Low | UI polish \+ profile visuals | Can follow once core voice flow works |

---

## **üß© Dependencies & Assumptions**

* Google Cloud account access (for speech-to-text)

* OpenAI GPT-4 API access

* Notion or Google Sheets API keys (initial storage)

  * Choose based on fastest setup for MVP

* lovable.dev environment ready for deployment

---

## **üõ† Future-Safe Considerations**

* Abstract data layer early so you can easily switch storage engines

* Use modular GPT prompt handling to allow upgrading to agent memory

* Build fallback logging for debugging (e.g., store raw voice+transcript)

* Maintain internal dashboard or log view for prompt processing issues
